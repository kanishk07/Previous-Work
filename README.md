# Previous-Work

My 'Previous-Work' folder here contains some of my previous coding work in bioinformatics and related subjects that I have done in my graduate journey. It also contains 3 pdfs of my Bachelor's thesis, Breast Cancer Analysis Stats project and Database Management Project. These are just some of my work and not all that I have done throughout my academic journey. 

Breast Cancer Project was done in 1st semester of my MS to classify the cancer as malignant or benign.

Coag_ML is the code for me and my advisor's published research work on coagulation prediction. (https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1680/12/9/873)

Kyphosis Analysis using decision tree is a project done using Random Forest and Decision Tree during my undergrad time to get a hang of machine learning algorithms.

Summer Projects with Python and R are both codes for Projects that I did in the summer of 2023 under Dr. Ramadevi at Texas Tech University of Health and Sciences, El Paso, Texas. They contain code for the data visualisation of the data that was provided to me by Dr. Ramadevi and her lab research. I also did computational molecular docking for her using a lot of different software and bioinformatics databases.
